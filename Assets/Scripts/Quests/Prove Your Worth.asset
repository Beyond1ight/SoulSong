  questDialogue:
  - Prove Your Worth
  - Is it true you burned down the Clock Tower yesterday? What were you thinking!
    If you want to make up for your foolishness, why don't you do the town a favor
    and clear out some of the monsters at the cave to the north west.
  - It won't restore the Clock Tower, but at least it will teach you both some discipline.
    Come back here when you're done.
  - I would suggest stocking up on a few Health Potions before you head out. Be careful,
    you're an idiot but I don't want you to be a dead one.

  - Prove Your Worth
  - Well now, I see you are back in one piece. I'm happy to see it, and I hope you
    were able to reflect on your actions a bit more while you were over there!
  - Don't burn down Clock Towers, I'm talking to you Mac. Burn down some monsters
    instead!
